Identifying and assessing structures in the lung from X-ray scans of 
the chest is an essential task across multiple diseases involving the 
lungs and upper abdomen, e.g., lung cancer, infections, pneumonia, broken ribs, and more. 
X-ray images can provide a detailed view of the lungs and surrounding structures, making it 
possible to detect, analyze, monitor, and assess treatment response. Computer-aided 
diagnostic tools addressing chest X-rays are important in medical imaging, 
possibly increasing speed, accuracy, consistency, and cost-effectiveness. 


Goals 
●  Create a deep learning system to detect one or more of 14 conditions directly from one or more chest 
X-rays (see data link below for details).  
●  Investigate and apply techniques for “Explainable AI.”
